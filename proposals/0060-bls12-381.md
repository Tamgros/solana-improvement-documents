## Summary

Many products would benefit from pairing friendly curves on Solana

## Motivation

There are many zk applications being explored that truly make use of the blockchain's ability to give users control and secruity over very sensitive information, and not have to trust a specific entity.

Many of these applications in other ecosystems make use of bls12-381 for their pairing friendly curve type, so it would be helpful for the Solana protocol to have support.

## Alternatives Considered

It's my understanding that there are other options like bn245, but bls12-381 has been found to be more secrure, and have some performance improvements.

## Detailed Design

Explain the feature as if it was already implemented and you're explaining it
to another Solana core contributor. The generally means:

- Explain the proposed change and how it works
- Where the feature fits in to the runtime, core, or relevant sub-system
- How this feature was/could be implemented
- Interaction with other features
- Edge cases

## Impact

This proposal will affect dapp and protocol developers better use of zk-SNARKS

## Security Considerations

What security implications/considerations come with implementing this feature?
Are there any implementation-specific guidance or pitfalls?

## Drawbacks *(Optional)*

Why should we not do this?

## Backwards Compatibility *(Optional)*

Does the feature introduce any breaking changes? All incompatibilities and
consequences should be listed.
