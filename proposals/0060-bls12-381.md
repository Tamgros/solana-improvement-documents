## Summary

Many products would benefit from pairing friendly curves on Solana

## Motivation

There are many zk applications being explored that truly make use of the blockchain's ability to give users control and secruity over very sensitive information, and not have to trust a specific entity.

Many of these applications in other ecosystems make use of bls12-381 for their pairing friendly curve type, so it would be helpful for the Solana protocol to have support.

## Alternatives Considered

It's my understanding that there are other options like bn245, but bls12-381 has been found to be more secrure, and have some performance improvements.

## Detailed Design

I'll need Sam Kim or other cryptography/ZK experts to explain all of the configurations to explore.

I've been told that precompiles for BLS12-381 operations: G_1, G_2 operations, pairing operations, and so on would be very useful

## Impact

This proposal will affect dapp and protocol developers better use of zk-SNARKS
